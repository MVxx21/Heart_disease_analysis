# Heart disease
Statistics with Python on real life data - patients diagnosed with heart disease.

The data are from a sample patients, from 1988, who were evaluated for heart disease at the [Cleveland Clinic Foundation](#https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). The data was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and then cleaned for analysis by [Code Accademy](#https://www.codecademy.com/). The initial data set include more than 70 attributes. 9 were retained in the cleaned dataset which we will use for this analysis.

Goal is to better understand heart disease through potential association with other conditions and or health observations to develop an intuition about the potential drivers for heart diseases (and tell my dad what habits he should change..!). We can list several associations assumptions which would make sense and test if they are satistically significant:
 
* cholesterol and heart disease
* knowing that heart disease risk is increase by diabete, the proportion of the population with diabete
* age and heart disease
* heart rate during exercise and heart disease
* chest pain and heart disease
* chest pain and heart rate during exercise

To test these assumptions, I reformulate them into hypothesis into the notebook.
